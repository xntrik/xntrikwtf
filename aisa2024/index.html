            ## Threat Modelling at the Speed of Git

            The following is a web-based presentation of a talk I gave at [AISA CyberCon Melbourne 2024](https://melbourne2024.cyberconference.com.au/).

              ### Overview

              - I'll attempt to distil a _**threat modelling philosophy**_ I have found myself drawn to time and time again
              - How _**software**_ fits into this approach
              - And finally, some _**open source**_ tools that can help you out - including a look at threatcl

            ### Hi

            My name is Christian Frichot, and I've had the privilege of working with several amazing organizations across Australia, the United States, and remotely. Among them, _**HashiCorp**_ stands out for teaching me the significance of "_developer flow_" and the critical need to minimize unnecessary friction and toil in the development process.

            Also working at the company that pioneered Infrastructure-as-Code had a profound impact on how I thought about documentation and configuration.

            ### A philosophy of threat modelling

            From my these experiences, I found myself thinking about these three threat modelling concepts, which form this threat modelling philosophy.

            1. Threat modelling is not just for security
            2. Threat models have to drive impact
            3. Threat modelling tools should align with software processes

            ### Threat modelling is not just the realm of security engineers

            Time and time again, I would run into confusion about who owns threat modelling, sometimes even talking to other security people who would tell me:

            > "I don’t know how to do threat modelling."

            ### Threat modelling is not just the realm of security engineers

            Even when I was in the consulting space, I remember having conversations with exceptional penetration testers, who would _actually perform_ threat modelling as part of an assessment - they would do this to help guide where they should focus their technical review - and these high skilled individuals would come back and say:

            > “Oh, but this isn’t capital-T threat modelling, I wouldn’t know how to do that.”

            - You need to leave the trail of breadcrumbs so that future software and security engineers have a clear baseline

            ### Keeping up with Change

            Diagrams, like documentation, are almost immediately deprecated in the face of change.

            DevOps, CI/CD - all these things are resulting in an environment where organisations are praised on their ability to ship code faster and faster. You often hear quotes such as:

            > “We deploy thousands of times a day to production.. “

            ### Keeping up with Change

            Threat modelling at this speed is really challenging. Especially if you're prioritising a collaborative approach. Running synchronous workshops is really great, but you can't run these continuously.

            While threat modelling can be performed asynchronously, this is also difficult when trying to keep up with this pace of change. - and the efforts will fall behind.

            One of the things that I really like about technologies such as Infra-as-Code, is that it lays the foundation that ideally you should leverage the same source-code management solution for your infra and ops environments, as you do for your products themselves.

            ### Why is this useful?

            - It uses a simple text format using HCL (so it looks like your terraform)

            The specification itself is powerful, and supports a lot of more advanced scenarios, such as these.

            - Include an initial threat model, and expand it
            - Import controls from other files, including remotely from git repos
            - Auto generate `information_asset` blocks from your actual terraform files!

            From here though, I thought, well, how do we normally secure source code files, can we use a similar approach to automatically flag gaps in our threat models?

            Using the threatcl cli you can already do things like validate whether a hcl meets the spec.

            ... but surely we can do more?

            But when you combine it with something like [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a popular open source static application security testing tool, you can do some awesome stuff.

            Out of the box, semgrep already knows how to process HCL files, so building rules isn’t that complex.

            ## Threat model as code + LLM ??
            
            And of course, as soon as you have a clearly defined specification of a threat model, it potentially has a pretty natural fit into what LLMs are pretty good at.

            Eh.. a bit weird

            But that's easy to fix, if you didn't want to write any HCL. Simply ask it to adjust it.
